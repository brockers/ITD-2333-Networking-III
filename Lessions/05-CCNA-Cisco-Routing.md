## Examples

* Configure a 172.16.1.100 with a gateway of 172.16.0.100
	* What would the netmask be?
	* How many IP addresses would be available?
* Show windows Route table
	* route print
	
## Cross router configuration

* Gateway of last resort
	* ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.0.0.1
* Static Routing
	* ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1
